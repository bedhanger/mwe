cat <<EOM
You can run a command like "make menuconfig" or similar to progress.  Then commit the changes made
to .config, merge them back to the master branch, and push them to the origin remote.  Then run

	make colonel --makefile=make.colonel ; exit

to start the build of the kernel and the (in- as well as the out-of-tree) kernel modules.
Exit the root shell afterwards.
