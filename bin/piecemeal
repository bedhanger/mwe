   ${me} [option...] action

Run action in increments to completion.

The action must have some sort of means to detect when it is
finished; for example, a download should *resume* at the
position where it was forced to stop earlier on.

Good examples:
   piecemeal youtube-dl some-big-file
   piecemeal wget --continue when-data-rate-degrades-over-time

BAD example:
   piecemeal sleep for-a-very-long-time

Boderline:
   piecemeal make

The first two examples are positive cases in point, they will
eventually finish the download, making numerous stoppages and
resumptions in between so as to either not overrun a
time-related download quota or to gain form the initial large
troughput of a freshly opened connection.

The BAD example, unless the default duration is set higher than
the intended sleep time, will never finish, as a simple sleep
has no notion of resuming.

The borderline case is demonstrated by the make invocation:
depending on how cleverly the Makefile was written, make may be
able to determine where it left off last time.  However, a
Makefile which does not get the dependencies right makes make
act like sleep with respect to step-by-step completion.

The following can be used to fine-tune the behaviour [default
values are shown in brackets]:

   --duration=...    the length of time of a single leg of the
                     action [${duration}]

   --retry-delay=... idle-time between successive legs of the
                     action [${retry_delay}]

   --verbose         show (on stderr) the status of the action
                     (running, pausing, finished) [${verbose}]

EOM
