# Call fetchmail, but map its NOMAIL return code to success

# fetchmail returns 0 when all marked messages could be
# retrieved, and 1 when no mail was found (other values indicate
# trouble).  While this has its uses, it is rather hindersome in
# cronjobs or when run from systemd timers, or---in
# general---when the ``no news'' condition should not be treated
# as an error.  The FAQ proposes the method we've implemented
# below, and it seems to be working fine for cronjobs (they are
# shell-agnostic).  For systemd timers, since they aren't
# shell-agnostic, a wrapper is more appropriate.

NOMAIL=1

# The error codes are mapped thuswise:
# 0 ---> 0
# 1 ---> 0
# n ---> 1

exec fetchmail "${@}" || test ${?} -eq ${NOMAIL}
